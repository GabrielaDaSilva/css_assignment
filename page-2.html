    <h3>Awe Inspiring</h3>
    <p><i>"Traveling from CA back to IN we just had to check this out!!! My wife found it as one of the attractions of Rt.
      66, so we went to find it. We came at it from the east so we didn't hear it right away. We turned around and were
      heading back east and I just happened to wander across the rumble strip and caught a small part of the tune. We
      turned back around.......twice, to hit it again, and WOW!!! Choked both of us up!! Music should evoke
      emotion.....if it doesn't, you should find something else to listen to, and music about our beautiful couintry,
      should evoke emotion."</i></p>
    <h3>A Singing Road</h3>
    <p><i>"Where else can you hear a road singing. Worth it just to say you did it. Stay to the right and don't go too
      fast. The road isn't marked but you will see dark patches to the right. Dont forget to turn off your radio."</i></p>
